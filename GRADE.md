Inga,

Great job! This truly showcases your abilities, and it's great to see how far you've come. The code is concise and in the right places, and you definitely took everything a step further and made the user experience very nice.

A couple of comments for you:

1. Your views look good, but you definitely want to make sure to place all of the repeated elements in the layout (application.html.erb) file. Tags such as `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, etc should be in this file to make sure we are not duplicating anything.

2. You have a `link` tag to style.css. Remember that Rails handles all static assets and you don't need to link any of them manually.
